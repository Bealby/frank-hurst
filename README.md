Frank’s first book, ‘The Postmistress of Nong Khai’ was the first
of three in his‘Golden Triangle’ series. The second ‘The Chiang
Mai Assignment’ was published in November 2017 and the final book
of the trilogy ‘Mekong Dragon’ was published June 2019. His books,
which have received wide acclaim, are authentic crime thrillers
based in England and Thailand. They follow the adventures of
intelligence officer Mike Rawlin as he tries to capture a dangerous
international drugs trafficker in South East Asia.

Frank was himself a former drugs intelligence officer who
travelled widely during his career and his writing has the ring
of authenticity on every page. The books are about secrets, romance,
and rivalry in the dangerous jungles of the Golden Triangle and the
corridors of power in London where deception and conspiracy loom at
every turn.
