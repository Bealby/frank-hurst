                <i>That was some saga with a tense nail-biting conclusion. Enjoyable as a individual read but I do
                    recommend initially reading the previous two to complete the trilogy. I certainly got a sense of
                    all
                    the different characters both good and evil and it opened my eyes to the nasty world of the drug
                    trade. Thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric drama, well portrayed in Frank Hurst's writing of a
                    country he obviously knows well.</i>

                <i>Having read the previous two books in this series i was keen to read Mekong Dragon. Well i was
                    not
                    disappointed the story continued from the previous books keeping me gripped all the way through.
                    Frank Hurst has done a fantastic job with Mekong Dragon and will hopefully write some more
                    books.</i>
