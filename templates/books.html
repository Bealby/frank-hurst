            <p class="text-muted">Frank has just completed his latest novel ‘The Peccavi Plot’, a nineteenth century
                crime and espionage
                thriller.
                When Marylebone hansom cab driver, Henry Gough is forced to cross the line of Victorian respectability
                in
                order
                to feed his family, he is drawn towards city districts awash with vice and crime. Stumbling onto a
                clandestine
                plot that will imperil his country, he turns informer and embarks on a dramatic adventure beset with
                danger.
                The
                story draws us effortlessly and in some style into the narrow, dimly-lit streets of London’s East End
                and to
                the
                grand estates of Tsarist Russia where foreign forces seek to challenge British imperial ambitions in the
                Orient.
                Brimming with political intrigue, riddles, romance, violence and deception, this is a fabulous story
                with
                more
                than a grain of truth at its core … Published by LR Price Publishing, ‘The Peccavi Plot’ is expected to
                be
                launched in the summer of 2021.

            <p class="text-left pt-4 text-muted">
                In his Golden Triangle Trilogy, Frank Hurst takes us into the treacherous and often violent world of
                late
                twentieth century global drugs smuggling. The stories follow the adventures of British intelligence
                officer
                Mike Rawlin as
                he struggles to capture Bartholomew Vanderpool, a dangerous and cruel international heroin trafficker.
                The
                books possess a unique authenticity, effortlessly steering the reader behind the scenes, including a
                fascinating and
                exhilarating journey from the steamy opium jungles of South East Asia to the chilly corridors of power
                in
                London where deception and conspiracy loom at every turn.</p>

            <p class="text-left text-muted">Passion, intrigue and duplicity provide a
                heady mix in these vivid stories woven together with an authenticity and knowledge of the international
                drugs scene few, if
                any, can match.</p>

                    of
                    Nong Khai</strong> sees
                Rawlin, a much-respected agent of the Crown, fall for his bewitching informant, setting him on a path
                that
                could wreck his investigation and destroy his life. A spellbinding read about an officer on the edge –
                the
                edge of
                self-indulgence, the edge of legality and the edge of loyalty.</p>

                fellow
                officers,
                Rawlin is dispatched to
                the mountains and sweltering forests of northern Thailand. Here he accepts an offer from MI6 to help him
                trap his long-time adversary. But all is not what it seems and he finds himself locked into a three-way
                struggle from which
                there can only be one victor.</p>

            <p class="text-left text-muted">The final tale of the trilogy, <strong>Mekong Dragon</strong>, sees a
                reversal of roles as
                Mike
                Rawlin becomes the prey rather than the huntsman. When his nemesis decides to retaliate, Rawlin’s
                survival
                depends as
                much on his courage and ingenuity as on the loyalty of others.</p>
