        <p>Frank has just completed his latest novel ‘The Peccavi Plot’, a nineteenth century crime and espionage
            thriller.
            When Marylebone hansom cab driver, Henry Gough is forced to cross the line of Victorian respectability in
            order
            to feed his family, he is drawn towards city districts awash with vice and crime. Stumbling onto a
            clandestine
            plot that will imperil his country, he turns informer and embarks on a dramatic adventure beset with danger.
            The
            story draws us effortlessly and in some style into the narrow, dimly-lit streets of London’s East End and to
            the
            grand estates of Tsarist Russia where foreign forces seek to challenge British imperial ambitions in the
            Orient.
            Brimming with political intrigue, riddles, romance, violence and deception, this is a fabulous story with
            more
            than a grain of truth at its core … Published by LR Price Publishing, ‘The Peccavi Plot’ is expected to be
            launched in the summer of 2021.
