            <p class="text-muted content-mb">
                Frank Hurst has just completed his latest novel, the second exhilarating story of his new Hansom Cab
                Trilogy.</p>
            <p class="text-muted content-mb">An extraordinary turn of events sees cab proprietor, Henry Gough propelled
                from the familiar streets of Victorian London
                into the grip of a stirring adventure, full of danger, political intrigue and ruthless treachery in
                faraway Siam.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted content-mb">When Henry becomes the only witness to the brutal murder of his passenger
                on one of London's richest avenues, he is
                given a clandestine mission to perform - one which will end on the banks of Bangkok's steamy Chao Phraya
                River. As he
                uncovers a sinister plot that will bring chaos to Siam, Henry draws ever closer to revealing the
                assassin's true
                identity, and is forced to confront powerful forces that threaten his own life.</p>
            <p class="text-muted content-mb">As Britain and France's colonial ambitions clash inside the court of King
                Chulalongkorn, the scene is set for a bitter
                struggle that will decide the fate of Siam itself.</p>
            <p class="text-muted content-mb">The Bangkok Betrayal is a breathtaking addition to the series of Henry
                Gough novels that began with The Peccavi Plot.</p>
            <p class="text-muted content-mb">“While twists and turns abound, the story retains the authenticity for
                which Hurst's writing is so renowned.”</p>
