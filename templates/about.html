            <p class="text-muted margin-about-section2 content-mb">Frank’s first book, ‘The Postmistress of
                Nong Khai’
                was the
                first of three in his
                ‘Golden Triangle’
                series.
                The second ‘The Chiang Mai Assignment’ was published in November 2017 and the final book of the trilogy
                ‘Mekong Dragon’ was published June 2019. His books, which have received wide acclaim, are authentic
                crime
                thrillers based in England and Thailand. They follow the adventures of intelligence officer Mike Rawlin
                as
                he tries to capture a dangerous international drugs trafficker in South East Asia.
